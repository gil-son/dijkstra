## Introduction

<p>Created by computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959, this algorithm solves the shortest path problem in a graph. This algorithm shows the importance of mathematics in conjunction with programming logic.</p>

<p>There is a report in which Dijkstra asked himself:</p>

<p>"What is the shortest distance from Rotterdam to Groningen?"</p>

<p>20 minutes later he created a solution ...</p>

<p>Google maps uses more refined and complex algorithms. To get there it is interesting to understand subjects simpler like that.</p>

## Stages

<p>I am recreating based on observation.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		* [x] Test before you start;
	</li>
	<li>
		* [x] Recreated without consult;
	</li>
	<li>
		* [x] Consult and compare.
	</li>
